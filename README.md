# Building-a-Content-Based-Filtering-Movie-Recommendation-System
This repository contains a Python implementation of a content-based filtering movie recommendation system. The system analyzes movie attributes such as genre, director, cast, and plot keywords to provide personalized recommendations. 

**Context**
* The company's video streaming service is currently powered by a recommendation system that employs collaborative filtering. This approach leverages the viewing patterns and preferences of our user base as a whole to generate recommendations. While effective in many cases, it can sometimes fall short in capturing the nuanced tastes of individual users and suggesting truly personalized content.

**Objective**
* To address these limitations, the producer is curious about the potential of a content-based filtering system as an alternative or complementary approach. Content-based filtering focuses on the inherent characteristics of movies themselves, such as genre, director, cast, and plot keywords, to identify movies similar to those a user has previously enjoyed. His objective is to determine if this approach can enhance the quality and relevance of our recommendations, ultimately leading to a more satisfying user experience.

**Data and Methodology**
* This project will utilize the movie_data.csv dataset, a comprehensive repository of information on 3,729 movies released on our platform since 2012. This dataset provides a rich source of descriptive features for each film, including title, director, cast, release year, rating, duration, listed genres, and a detailed plot summary. Next, find the Python code that you can find here and use it as inspiration: adjust it in such a way that it can be run on the current dataset.
